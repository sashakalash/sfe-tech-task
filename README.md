# 💪 SFE Tech Task

Welcome! This project is a small Angular-based application designed to assess your frontend skills with a realistic setup. It includes a backend built in Node.js with an in-memory database, and a frontend written in Angular 19 using the latest standalone and signal-based patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd sfe-tech-task
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

The backend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 3. Start the Frontend

If you are still in the backend folder, go back to the root folder:

```bash
npm install
ng serve
```

The frontend will run on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## ✅ What’s Already Implemented

### 🔐 Auth

- A login page is scaffolded using Angular Material.
- `AuthService.login()` is implemented and connects to the backend.
- Backend API accepts hardcoded credentials (see `backend/db.js`).

### 👥 User Management

- A working API for fetching, creating, and updating users exists.
- Angular architecture follows best practices:
  - **Dumb components** for UI
  - **Smart container pages** for logic
  - **Facade → Store → Service** pattern for state and API management
- Routes:
  - `GET /users` — user list
  - `POST /users/create` — create user
  - `PUT /users/:id` — edit user

## 🧐 Your Task

Your goal is to complete the app’s functionality using Angular best practices.

### 🔐 Auth

- Implement logic in `LoginPage` to store and share the token with other API calls.
- Protect all `/users` routes from unauthorized access.

### 👥 Users

- Make the user form fully functional for **creating and editing users**.
- Add **form validation** (e.g., required fields, custom validators). You might notice that there is a validation on the BE to not have **test** in the name, try to prevent sending those requests from the FE.
- Display loading states and error messages as needed.
- Fix any subtle bugs in the existing logic or API integration (if popping up, of course you don't need to touch backend).

---

## ✨ Bonus Points

These are optional but will showcase advanced skills:

- Add **unit tests**.
- Improve **UI/UX**.

---

## 🧹 Git Commit Guidelines

- Start with an **initial empty commit** (e.g., `chore: start tech task`) when beginning your work.
- Use **small, clear commits** to document your progress.
- End with a **final commit** (e.g., `feat: complete tech task`) when you have finished.
- We value **clean and readable Git history**!

---

## 📬 Submission

1. **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Complete the task in your forked repo.
3. Send us the link to your fork when you're finished.

Good luck! We’re looking forward to seeing how you approach the challenge and what best practices you're going to introduce for us 🚀
